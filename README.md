# AdventOfCode ([Link](https://adventofcode.com/))

"Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015. The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_of_Code)

This repository contains my implementation for the daily quizzes.

## Running the code (with example data)

- Create a poetry shell and install `poetry shell && poetry install`
- Run script for specific day `poetry run <day>`
